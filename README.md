# VisualTree - a visualized tool

### It's used for

- create a binary tree
- demonstrate the traversal process of the binary tree

### So how to use it?

- Click on an existing node once to select,then move your cursor untill it reaches a suitable position and click again.By doing this you can create a child node.In this way you can create a binary tree.

  Each node of a binary tree has at most two children.The tool puts a limit on this.

  The tool distinguishes the left child from the right child based on the relative position of the nodes.
